# Progress: KunaiCat Social Links Hub

## What Works
- ✅ Social links functionality
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Color scheme and styling
- ✅ Icon integration
- ✅ GitHub Pages deployment
- ✅ Mobile compatibility
- ✅ Local development setup
- ✅ Modular component structure
- ✅ CSS organization
- ✅ Component templating
- ✅ Basic Python-based template generation
- ✅ Component variant system with dot notation

## Current Status
The website has been successfully refactored with an enhanced template-based generation system using component variants and dot notation. This modular approach provides a clear 1:1 mapping between templates and data, making the system more maintainable and extensible for future features.

### Active Features
- Social media links grid
- Styled button components
- Hover effects
- Mobile responsiveness
- Custom favicon
- Component templates
- CSS modules
- Theme variables
- JSON data source
- Template-based generation
- Component variant system
- Default + variant data structure

## What's Left to Build
### Immediate Tasks (Enhanced Templating System)
1. Component Variant System
   - [x] Create component.variant reference syntax
   - [x] Implement recursive template processing
   - [x] Add default.json fallback logic
   - [x] Support data merging between default and variant files

2. Data Structure Reorganization
   - [x] Create component-specific data directories
   - [x] Convert social_links.json to individual component data files
   - [x] Create default.json for each component type
   - [x] Implement variant-specific JSON files

3. Generator Refactoring
   - [x] Update template parser for dot notation
   - [x] Implement component resolution logic
   - [x] Create data merging utilities
   - [x] Add better error handling and logging

4. Testing & Documentation
   - [x] Verify all component variants render correctly
   - [ ] Document new templating system architecture
   - [ ] Update README with usage examples
   - [ ] Add system diagrams for template resolution

### Future Enhancements (Not Started)
- Blog functionality with Markdown processing
- Gallery pages
- Navigation components
- CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions
- Additional social links

## Evolution of Decisions
### Initial Implementation
- Single HTML file with embedded styles
- Direct SVG icon integration
- Grid-based layout system

### Current Implementation
- Modular component architecture
- Separated CSS modules
- Reusable component templates
- Theme variable system
- Organized directory structure
- Basic template variable replacement

### Latest Implementation
- Component variant system with dot notation
- Component-specific data directories
- Default data with variant overrides
- Recursive template processing
- Clear 1:1 mapping between templates and data

### Lessons Learned
1. Benefits of New Structure:
   - Easier to maintain and update
   - Components are reusable
   - Styles are organized and consistent
   - Ready for future expansion

2. Improvements Made:
   - Better separation of concerns
   - Modular style organization
   - Component templating system
   - Consistent theming approach
   - Content-presentation separation

3. Recent Improvements:
   - More intuitive component referencing
   - Reduced data redundancy via defaults
   - Better scaling for growing component library
   - Easier addition of new component variants
   - More maintainable and extendable system
