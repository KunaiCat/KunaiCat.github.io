# Progress: KunaiCat Social Links Hub

## What Works
- ✅ Social links functionality
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Color scheme and styling
- ✅ Icon integration
- ✅ GitHub Pages deployment
- ✅ Mobile compatibility
- ✅ Local development setup
- ✅ Modular component structure
- ✅ CSS organization
- ✅ Component templating

## Current Status
The website has been successfully refactored into a modular structure. We are now implementing a template-based site generation system using Python to enhance maintainability and prepare for future features like blog functionality.

### Active Features
- Social media links grid
- Styled button components
- Hover effects
- Mobile responsiveness
- Custom favicon
- Component templates
- CSS modules
- Theme variables

## What's Left to Build
### Immediate Tasks (Template System)
1. Template Format Update
   - [ ] Update templates to use `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` format
   - [ ] Create templates/ directory structure
   - [ ] Move component templates to new location

2. Data Structure
   - [ ] Create social_links.json data file
   - [ ] Define schema for social links data
   - [ ] Extract existing content to data file

3. Python Generator
   - [ ] Create generate_site.py script
   - [ ] Implement template loading
   - [ ] Add placeholder replacement logic
   - [ ] Set up HTML generation

4. Testing & Verification
   - [ ] Test generated site against current version
   - [ ] Verify all links and styles
   - [ ] Document generation process

### Future Enhancements (Not Started)
- Blog functionality with Markdown processing
- Gallery pages
- Navigation components
- CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions
- Additional social links

## Evolution of Decisions
### Initial Implementation
- Single HTML file with embedded styles
- Direct SVG icon integration
- Grid-based layout system

### Current Implementation
- Modular component architecture
- Separated CSS modules
- Reusable component templates
- Theme variable system
- Organized directory structure

### Next Implementation
- Python-based site generation
