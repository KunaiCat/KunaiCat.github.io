# Active Context: KunaiCat Social Links Hub

## Current Focus
Refactoring the website to implement a modular component architecture while maintaining current functionality and appearance.

## Active Tasks
1. Component Separation
   - Extract embedded styles to separate CSS files
   - Create modular social button component
   - Implement CSS variables for theming

2. File Organization
   - Set up directory structure for components
   - Create separate style files
   - Organize utility classes

3. Testing
   - Verify visual consistency
   - Check responsive behavior
   - Test all social links

## Recent Changes
- Set up local development server
- Created memory bank documentation
- Analyzed current implementation

## Next Steps
1. Create directory structure for modular components
2. Extract CSS variables to separate file
3. Create social button component template
4. Move grid layout styles to separate file
5. Update index.html to use new component structure

## Active Decisions
1. Component Structure
   - Each component in separate HTML file
   - Associated styles in component-specific CSS file
   - Shared styles in utility CSS files

2. Style Organization
   - variables.css for theme configuration
   - components/ directory for component styles
   - utils/ directory for shared utilities

3. Development Workflow
   - Local preview using Python HTTP server
   - Manual testing across devices
   - Direct deployment to GitHub Pages

## Project Insights
- Current implementation is well-structured but monolithic
- Color scheme and design are effective
- Component patterns are consistent and reusable
- Mobile responsiveness is working well
